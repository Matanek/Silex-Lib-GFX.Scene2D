# Boids C++/Silex

This directory contains three witnesses used to separate native code quality
from the architectural cost of GFX's public Scene2D path:

- Silex uses injected systems, ECS, Rendering, Scene2D, SDL_GPU, the retained
  drawing shader, and one instanced draw;
- C++ architectural uses EnTT, SDL_GPU, the same retained drawing shader, the
  same vertex and instance layouts, and one instanced draw;
- C++ direct keeps the minimal `std::vector` and SDL_Renderer implementation as
  a lower-layer throughput witness.

All three programs preserve the same quadratic algorithm, one flock snapshot per
frame, the same simulation constants, a 960 × 640 logical window requesting a
high-density framebuffer, immediate presentation without VSync, and a
five-second measurement period. Pass `4000` explicitly to every executable for
a valid comparison. Always compare the reported logical and pixel dimensions;
a run whose presentation mode or dimensions differ is invalid.

## Silex/GFX

From the SilexProject workspace root:

```sh
Silex/Toolchain/zig-out/bin/silex compile \
    Packages/GFX.Scene2D/Benchmarks/Boids/Silex.sx \
    -o /private/tmp/gfx-boids-silex
/private/tmp/gfx-boids-silex 4000
```

The output has this form:

```text
SILEX_GFX_BOIDS count=4000 present=immediate fps=80.0 window=960.0x640.0 pixels=1920.0x1280.0 scale=2.0 density=2.0
```

## C++23 witnesses

The C++ witnesses require an SDL3 development installation and the
`shadercross` command discoverable by CMake. The build uses an installed EnTT 4
package when available or fetches the pinned `v4.0.0` release otherwise. These
are benchmark-only build dependencies and do not enter the Silex package or
its public API.

```sh
cmake \
    -S Packages/GFX.Scene2D/Benchmarks/Boids/Cpp \
    -B /private/tmp/gfx-boids-cpp \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build /private/tmp/gfx-boids-cpp --config Release
/private/tmp/gfx-boids-cpp/BoidsCppDirect 4000
/private/tmp/gfx-boids-cpp/BoidsCppArchitectural 4000
```

The direct output has this form:

```text
CPP_DIRECT_BOIDS count=4000 present=immediate fps=86.0 window=960x640 pixels=1920x1280 scale=2.0 density=2.0
```

The architectural output has this form:

```text
CPP_ARCHITECTURAL_BOIDS count=4000 ecs=entt renderer=sdl_gpu present=immediate fps=86.0 window=960x640 pixels=1920x1280 scale=2.0 density=2.0
```

## Comparison protocol

Compile before starting the series, close other graphical workloads, perform
several warm-up runs, and then rotate between the three executables. Compare at
least five results per version and use the medians. Compilation and shader
translation time are not part of the FPS measurement.

`RunComparison.sh` automates that complete protocol from any working directory:

```sh
Packages/GFX.Scene2D/Benchmarks/Boids/RunComparison.sh --wait
```

By default it builds all three Release executables, discards one warm-up per
witness, records seven processes per witness in Silex, C++ architectural, C++
direct order, validates their count and normalized display metadata, and writes
a timestamped raw log under `Benchmarks/Baselines/`. The final terminal table
and log comments report the median, range, median absolute deviation (MAD), and
relative difference from the architectural C++ witness.

Run it from an external terminal with `--wait` when the Codex process or other
workloads may affect the result. After the build finishes, close those workloads
and press Return in the terminal. Use `--runs`, `--warmups`, `--output`, or
`--build-dir` to override the capture without editing the script; `--skip-build`
reuses executables already present in that build directory.

The architectural C++ witness is the closest comparison for Silex/GFX. It
matches the major ECS, GPU upload, shader, instancing, presentation, and data
layout costs without pretending to duplicate GFX's scheduler or FrameGraph.
The direct witness remains a useful lower-layer ceiling, not a layer-for-layer
comparison.
