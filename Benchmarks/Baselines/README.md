# Boids performance baselines

This directory archives raw output from the three witnesses in
[`../Boids`](../Boids). The records are performance controls, not correctness
tests or portable timing claims.

## 2026-08-26 clean pre-fix regression control

[`2026-08-26-101358-arm64-boids.log`](2026-08-26-101358-arm64-boids.log) is a
user-run capture made after waiting for competing workloads. Its repository
metadata was clean and it follows the package runner's complete seven-round
protocol. It records the state immediately before restoring the immutable
Canvas fast path in Scene2D, and is retained as the regression control for that
change.

| Witness | Median | MAD | Range | Relative to C++ architectural |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Silex/GFX | 83.468 FPS | 0.69% | 82.889-84.631 FPS | -3.67% |
| C++ architectural | 86.645 FPS | 0.27% | 86.150-87.109 FPS | reference |
| C++ direct | 85.751 FPS | 0.15% | 85.610-86.741 FPS | -1.03% |

This control demonstrates the regression under an uncontended capture; it is
not the post-fix acceptance result. A matching capture from the corrected
revision must be compared with it before accepting the recovered performance.

## 2026-08-26 clean post-fix control

[`2026-08-26-110454-arm64-boids.log`](2026-08-26-110454-arm64-boids.log) is the
first clean seven-round capture of Scene2D commit `4d52dbd`, after restoring
the immutable Canvas fast path. The host had waited for competing workloads,
and every recorded configuration field matches the pre-fix control above.

| Witness | Median | MAD | Range | Relative to C++ architectural |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Silex/GFX | 83.548 FPS | 0.21% | 83.370-84.035 FPS | -3.13% |
| C++ architectural | 86.250 FPS | 0.12% | 85.951-86.952 FPS | reference |
| C++ direct | 85.646 FPS | 0.13% | 85.454-85.766 FPS | -0.70% |

This result is stable but remains below the earlier 87-88 FPS observations.
It therefore freezes the corrected revision under this machine state without
claiming that the wider Scene2D performance gap has been resolved.

## 2026-08-26 compact-packing candidate observation

[`2026-08-26-144618-arm64-boids.log`](2026-08-26-144618-arm64-boids.log) was
captured after a deep-sleep wake, with the compact instance-packing working
tree later committed as `12ce794`. The runner reports dirty source repositories,
so this is an exploratory control rather than clean acceptance evidence.

| Witness | Median | MAD | Range | Relative to C++ architectural |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Silex/GFX | 88.591 FPS | 0.37% | 84.277-88.919 FPS | -2.19% |
| C++ architectural | 90.575 FPS | 0.80% | 88.105-91.426 FPS | reference |
| C++ direct | 88.926 FPS | 2.05% | 85.924-90.963 FPS | -1.82% |

The higher absolute values across all three witnesses are consistent with host
state materially affecting throughput. The relative ordering still leaves C++
architectural ahead of Silex, while the wide Silex and C++ direct ranges make
small cross-process differences unsuitable as acceptance criteria.

## 2026-08-26 contended macOS ARM64 observation

[`2026-08-26-arm64-boids.log`](2026-08-26-arm64-boids.log) compares the three
4,000-boid executables on the same Apple M3 Pro host. All programs used
immediate presentation, a 960 x 640 logical window, a 1920 x 1280 framebuffer,
and a five-second measurement interval. One warm-up process per executable was
discarded, then seven isolated processes per witness were recorded in rotating
Silex, C++ architectural, C++ direct order.

The Codex agent remained active during this capture. A later user-run Silex
process reached 84.7 FPS, while a one-round runner smoke reached the expected
higher C++ ranges. This file is therefore retained as evidence of scheduling
sensitivity and raw historical output, not as the accepted performance
baseline. Replace its acceptance role with a capture produced from an external
terminal after closing Codex and other competing workloads.

| Witness | Median | MAD | Range | Relative to C++ architectural |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Silex/GFX | 81.664 FPS | 0.14% | 81.265-81.776 FPS | -3.66% |
| C++ architectural | 84.763 FPS | 0.11% | 84.535-85.065 FPS | reference |
| C++ direct | 84.110 FPS | 0.04% | 84.019-84.299 FPS | -0.77% |

The architectural C++ witness is the primary comparison because it matches
the ECS, SDL_GPU, shader, instancing, presentation, and data-layout costs of
the public Scene2D path. The direct SDL_Renderer witness exercises a different,
lower-level path and is retained only as a secondary throughput control.

The Silex median is 2.28% below the 83.573 FPS median archived by the
GFX.Physics Spec 13 acceptance session on the same host and compiler revision.
Because this capture had a competing workload and that older session used
another Scene2D revision, the difference does not by itself establish a code
regression.

## Capture protocol

Build all three executables before starting the measurements, close other
graphical workloads, and pass `4000` explicitly. Discard one warm-up process
for each executable, then rotate between the three executables for at least
seven recorded processes each. Reject any run whose count, presentation mode,
logical window, pixel dimensions, scale, or density differs from the archived
configuration. Compare medians and report median absolute deviation (MAD) as a
percentage of the median.

The package-owned runner applies this protocol and produces a timestamped log:

```text
Packages/GFX.Scene2D/Benchmarks/Boids/RunComparison.sh --wait
```

Future records should retain the raw sentinel lines and enough host, compiler,
package, and dependency revisions to reproduce the configuration. Do not
archive serial numbers, hardware UUIDs, usernames, or absolute home paths.
